# 👋 Hi, I’m @RitabrataRoychowdhury

🔧 I’m a Software Developer at **NextZen Minds Pte Ltd (full-time)** and a **Senior Software Engineer (part-time)** at **HawkShield**, passionate about building scalable systems, automating DevOps workflows, and integrating intelligent AI/ML solutions into real-world applications.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🔧 **Microservices Architecture**: Migrated monolithic systems to microservices using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, RabbitMQ, and the strangler pattern—developed and maintained over 100+ RESTful APIs.
- 🔐 **Secure Infrastructure (HawkShield)**: Integrated AWS SSM and HashiCorp Vault for secrets and key management via TypeScript APIs, automating key rotation and enhancing security governance.
- ⚙️ **DevOps & CI/CD**: Designed robust GitLab CI/CD pipelines, optimized Dockerfiles and Helm charts for microservices, and enabled blue-green deployments on AWS ECS, reducing deployment failures by 30%.
- 🛡️ **Authentication & Authorization (DMS)**: Built a centralized OAuth2-based SSO system with Keycloak and Spring Security, leveraging Redis for token and user data caching across distributed services.
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployments**: Managed production-ready microservices on AWS EC2 and EKS with auto-scaling, health checks, and centralized logging.
- 🤖 **AI Integrations**: Developed Java SDK wrappers for AI agents (Gemini & Mistral), powering conversational modules within an HMS platform.
- 📄 **Document Management System**: Designed MongoDB GridFS layers, integrating Apache Tika and Tesseract OCR for intelligent document parsing and metadata extraction.
